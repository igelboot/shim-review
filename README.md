IGEL is a vendor of thin client hardware and software.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What product or service is this for:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is for IGEL's Linux-based thin client operating system, which is called IGEL OS. There are three products based on IGEL OS:

- IGEL OS (LX), the operating system for IGEL's own thin client devices
- Universal Desktop Converter 3 (UDC3), a live-bootable Linux system that installs IGEL OS on third-party devices
- UD Pocket, a live-bootable variant of IGEL OS on a pen drive

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's the justification that this really does need to be signed for the whole world to be able to boot it:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- IGEL wants to employ Secure Boot for building a trusted operating system from Shim to GRUB to the kernel to signed filesystem partitions. Secure Boot is the first step for this.
- IGEL would like customers to be able to run Universal Desktop Converter 3 (UDC3) on any amd64 device without disabling Secure Boot.
- IGEL would like UD Pocket to be bootable on any amd64 device without disabling Secure Boot.
